# code-development-review-checklist
## Introduction
As a developer, it has been a struggle on how we can standardize our code.
This guideline is a result of our experience from some of our projects. I hope it will help you as much as it helped us.

## Code formatting
While going through the code, check the code formatting to improve its readability and ensure that there are no blockers

[&check;] Ensure that code block starting point and ending point are easily identifiable

[&check;] Remove unnecessary empty lines

[&check;] Remove unused variables and excess codes

[&check;] Ensure that proper naming conventions (Pascal, CamelCase, etc.) are being followed.



## Coding best practices
No hard coding, use constants or configuration values.

[&check;] Break down code into small, modular functions and classes

[&check;] *Comments* — Do not write comments about what you are doing instead, write comments on why you are doing it. Specify any hacks, workaround, and temporary fixes. Additionally, mention pending tasks in your to-dos which can be tracked easily

[&check;] Use framework features wherever possible instead of writing custom code.

[&check;] Remember DRY ( Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle: The same code should not be repeated more than twice.

[&check;] Avoid the use of attributes such as ID, specific keys, etc., for one specific function or method. Use them for reusability only

[&check;] The naming of a variable should be precisely stating the value or content

[&check;] Naming functions or methods should be describing its use or action. Additionally, summaries should be a must in describing its use. Indicating the 

[&check;] Look for a way to simplify things but not degrading the current quality of the code.

[&check;] Code blocks should be readable and easy to understand

## Implementation Plan

[&check;] Define Objectives

  - [&check;]  Clearly outline the goals and objectives of the implementation
  - [&check;] Specify the expected outcomes and benefits

[&check;] Scope Definition

  - [&check;] Clearly define the scope of the implementation
  - [&check;] Identify the features and functionalities to be developed

[&check;] Requirements Analysis
  
  - [&check;] Review and confirm project requirements
  - [&check;] **Identify any potential gaps or uncertainties** in the requirements

[&check;] Risk Assessment

  - [&check;] Identify potential risks and challenges associated with the implementation
  - [&check;] Develop mitigation strategies for each identified risk

[&check;] Task Breakdown
  
  - [&check;] Break down the implementation into smaller tasks or user stories
  - [&check;] Define dependencies between tasks

[&check;] Timeline and Milestones

  - [&check;] Develop a timeline for the implementation
  - [&check;] Set milestones and deadlines for key deliverables

[&check;] Unplanned Cases and Edge Cases

  - [&check;] Identify potential unplanned scenarios and edge cases.
  - [&check;] Develop strategies for handling unforeseen issues

[&check;] Testing

  - [&check;] Develop a comprehensive testing plan
  - [&check;] Include unit testing, integration testing, and system testing


## Dependancy

[&check;] Avoid maximu inter function dependancy (like one function dependnts another one)

[&check;] Follow Single Responsibility Principle

## Project

[&check;] Clear understanding of project, existing code structure, how the code/packages/files aligned..etc
